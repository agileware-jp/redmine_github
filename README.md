# Redmine GitHub plugin

_redmine_github_ is a Redmine plugin for connecting a local Redmine installation to a remote GitHub repository.

The plugin allows to:

- Syncronize remote GitHub repository to a local Git one. All Git-related Redmine features can be used!
- Attach pull request (PR) status icons to issues. These will change in real time, when pull request status change: created, approved, merged, etc.
- Connect git commit comments to issues via Redmine's [referencing issues in commit messages](https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineSettings#Referencing-issues-in-commit-messages).

## Getting started

### 1. Install the plugin

```shell
cd {LOCAL_REDMINE_DIRECTORY}/plugins
```


#### via Git clone

```shell
git clone https://github.com/agileware-jp/redmine_github.git
```

#### or from downloaded release archive file

```shell
tar xvzpf redmine_github....
```

#### Install gems and migrate the database

```shell
cd {LOCAL_REDMINE_DIRECTORY}
bundle install
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate
```

#### Restart your Redmine

After restarting check _redmine_github_ plugin is listed in `Administration->Plugins`.

### 2. Enable Github as an SCM

As per [Redmine documentation](https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineRepositories), enable `Github` as an SCM you wish to use globally in `Administration->Settings->Repositories->Enabled SCM`.

### 3. Add a Github repository to a Redmine project

For given project, go to its `Settings->Repositories->New Repository` form and enter:

- **SCM:** `Github`
- **Main repository:** *(Optional)*
- **Identifier:** `YOUR-UNIQUE-IDENTIFIER`
  - *For example, you can simply use your Github repository's* `Repository name` *as its **Identifier** in Redmine.*
- **URL:** `https://github.com/USER|ORGANIZATION/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME`
  - *More info: [Clone address](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#about-remote-repositories)*
- **Access Token:** `YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN`
  - *More info: [Personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)*
- **Webhook Secret:** `YOUR-WEBHOOK-SECRET`
  - *More info: [Webhook secret](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/)*
- **Path encoding:** *(Optional)*
- **Report last commit for files and directories:** *(Optional)*

After pressing `Create` button, a bare-clone of your Github repository will be created inside your Redmine's install directory, at `{LOCAL_REDMINE_DIRECTORY}/repositories/`.

Now use the `Edit` or `Delete` links to take note of the **Repository ID**. You will need this ID in the next step to configure the webhook URL.

### 4. Connect GitHub to Redmine

1. Go to the Github repository's **Settings**
2. Select **Webhooks** and click `Add webhook`

- **Payload URL:** `[redmine_url]/redmine_github/:repository_id/webhook`
  - *For example* `https://redmine.org/redmine_github/1/webhook`
    - *Note: replace `:repository_id` with the **Repository ID** you noted in the previous step.*
- **Content type:** `application/json`
- **Secret:** `YOUR-WEBHOOK-SECRET`
  - *Use the same **Webhook Secret** defined in previous step when configuring your Redmine project's Repository.*
- **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?** `Let me select individual events`
  - `Pull requests`
  - `Pull request reviews`
  - `Pull request review comments`
  - `Pushes`
  - `Statuses`
  - `Commit comments`

### 5. Configure commit comments keywords

Use the `Administration->Settings->Repositories` tab to configure [commit comments keywords](https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineSettings#Referencing-issues-in-commit-messages).
