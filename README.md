# Redmine Github plugin

_redmine_github_ is a Redmine plugin for connecting a local Redmine installation to a remote Github repository. The plugin allows to:

- Syncronize remote Github repository to a local Git one - all Git-related Redmine features can be used
- Attach pull request (PR) status icons to issues - will change in real time, when pul request status change - created, approved, merged etc.
- Connect commit comment to issues via [Redmine commit comments keywords](<(https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineSettings#Referencing-issues-in-commit-messages)>)

## Getting started

### 1. Install the plugin

```shell
cd {LOCAL_REDMINE_DIRECTORY}/plugins
```

#### From downloaded release archive file

```shell
tar xvzpf redmine_github....
```

#### or via Git clone

```shell
git clone https://github.com/agileware-jp/redmine_github.git
```

#### Install gems and migrate the database

```shell
cd {LOCAL_REDMINE_DIRECTORY}
bundle install
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate
```

#### Restart you Redmine

After restart, also check if plugin is listed in the installed Redmine plugins list - _(Administration|Plugins)_

### 2. Add the repository to Redmine

For given project, in \_(Settings|Repositories|New Repository) form enter:

- _SCM_ - **Github**
- _Identifier_ - uniq repository identifier
- _URL_ - Github repository URL ([clone address](https://help.github.com/en/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use#cloning-with-https-urls-recommended), starting with `https://` )
- _Access Token_ - [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
- _Webhook Secret_ - [webhook secret](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/)

After pressing _'Create'_ button, bare-clone repository will be created inside your Redmine install directory - `{LOCAL_REDMINE_DIRECTORY}/repositories/` path.

> Note the **repository ID** in the _'Edit'_ and _'Delete'_ links - you will need this for the next step (webhook url)

### 3. Connecting Github to Redmine

1. Go to the repository _Settings_ interface on GitHub.
2. Under _Webhooks_ add a new webHook:

- The _Payload URL_ needs to be of the format: `[redmine_url]/redmine_github/:repository_id/webhook` (for example `http://redmine.example.com/redmine_github/1/webhook`). Repository ID is the one of the **created in the previous step repository**
- _Content type_: **application/json**
- _Secret_: **same as Webhook Secret inside you Redmine repository settings**
- _Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?_ - _Pull requests, Pull request reviews, Pull request review comments, Pushes, Statuses, Commit comments_

### 4. Configure commit comments keywords

In _(Administration|Settings)_ , _Repositories_ tab configure [commit comments keywords](https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineSettings#Referencing-issues-in-commit-messages).
